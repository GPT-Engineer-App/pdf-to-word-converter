# pdf-to-word-converter

develop a web application that facilitates the conversion of PDF documents into fully editable Word documents. The application should leverage OCR (Optical Character Recognition) libraries capable of supporting the Lao language. Users should be able to upload PDF files through a user-friendly interface. Upon submission, the application should process the PDF using the OCR technology, extracting the text while preserving formatting and layout as much as possible. The resulting editable Word document should be generated and made available for immediate viewing in Microsoft Word format. Users should also have the option to download the converted Word document for offline use. Your challenge is to design and implement this web application, ensuring seamless functionality, efficient processing, and a smooth user experience throughout the conversion and download process.
